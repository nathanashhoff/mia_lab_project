The comparison of segmentation performance between the Random Forest-based and Atlas-based methods, both with and without noise, revealed distinct trends across brain regions. These differences can be seen in Table \RNum{1}. For the amygdala, the Atlas-based method without noise achieved the highest Dice score (0.63 ± 0.08) compared to the Random Forest method (0.47 ± 0.06). With noise, the Atlas-based method scored slightly lower (0.61 ± 0.07) but still outperformed the Random Forest method (0.47 ± 0.06). Similarly, for the hippocampus, the Atlas-based method performed better in noisy conditions, achieving the highest Dice score (0.63 ± 0.06) compared to the performance without noise (0.61 ± 0.10), while the Random Forest method showed no variability, scoring consistently (0.43 ± 0.05).
In the thalamus, the Atlas-based method achieved the best performance without noise (0.79 ± 0.04), slightly decreasing in the presence of noise (0.78 ± 0.05), whereas the Random Forest method showed consistent performance (0.68 ± 0.10) across conditions. Contrastingly, for grey matter, the Random Forest method performed better with noise (0.74 ± 0.01) than without noise (0.73 ± 0.01), while the Atlas-based method performed significantly worse, scoring 0.53 ± 0.02 without noise and 0.52 ± 0.03 with noise. For white matter, the Random Forest method outperformed the Atlas-based method with a consistent Dice score of 0.83 ± 0.02 across noise conditions, whereas the Atlas-based method achieved 0.66 ± 0.03 in both cases.
Regarding computational time, the Atlas-based method was significantly faster, taking 6.0 ± 1.8 seconds without noise and 5.8 ± 0.7 seconds with noise. In contrast, the Random Forest method required substantially more time, taking 197.3 ± 6.3 seconds without noise and 209.0 ± 7.5 seconds with noise. These results demonstrate clear differences in segmentation performance and computational efficiency between the two methods.
