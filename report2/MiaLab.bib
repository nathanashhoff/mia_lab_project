	abstract = {Accurate segmentation of lungs in pathological thoracic computed tomography ({CT}) scans plays an important role in pulmonary disease diagnosis. However, it is still a challenging task due to the variability of pathological lung appearances and shapes. In this paper, we proposed a novel segmentation algorithm based on random forest ({RF}), deep convolutional network, and multi-scale superpixels for segmenting pathological lungs from thoracic {CT} images accurately. A pathological thoracic {CT} image is first segmented based on multi-scale superpixels, and deep features, texture, and intensity features extracted from superpixels are taken as inputs of a group of {RF} classifiers. With the fusion of classification results of {RFs} by a fractional-order gray correlation approach, we capture an initial segmentation of pathological lungs. We finally utilize a divide-and-conquer strategy to deal with segmentation refinement combining contour correction of left lungs and region repairing of right lungs. Our algorithm is tested on a group of thoracic {CT} images affected with interstitial lung diseases. Experiments show that our algorithm can achieve a high segmentation accuracy with an average {DSC} of 96.45\% and {PPV} of 95.07\%. Compared with several existing lung segmentation methods, our algorithm exhibits a robust performance on pathological lung segmentation. Our algorithm can be employed reliably for lung field segmentation of pathologic thoracic {CT} images with a high accuracy, which is helpful to assist radiologists to detect the presence of pulmonary diseases and quantify its shape and size in regular clinical practices.},

	abstract = {The interthalamic adhesion ({ITA}) is an understudied neuroanatomical structure that forms a bridge of tissue connecting the thalamus of each hemisphere across the midline whose functional significance remains largely unknown. The likelihood of {ITA} absence has been reported in some studies to be increased in males, but findings have been inconsistent. We used magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the size and absence of the {ITA} and their relationship to thalamic volume, putative indices of white matter integrity (fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity) within the anterior thalamic radiation and neuropsychological functions in 233 (129 M/104 F) healthy volunteers (age range 8–68). To ensure high reliability in this study two operators independently rated the absence of the {ITA} and measured its size for all individuals. The {ITA} was absent in 4\% of all individuals with no sex differences in its absence. Females had greater {ITA} size compared to males overall with both groups demonstrating nonlinear age-associated changes across the age range examined. {ITA} size among females correlated significantly with thalamus volume and lower mean diffusivity in the anterior thalamic radiation. Path modeling indicated that {ITA} size statistically mediated the relationship between age and attention among females. Our findings provide evidence for sex differences in {ITA} size across the lifespan, which are associated with the surrounding thalamic anatomy and neuropsychological functions.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}: Neurosurgical interventions of the thalamus rely on transferring stereotactic coordinates from an atlas onto the patient's {MR} brain images. We propose a prototype application for performing thalamus target map individualization by fusing patient-specific thalamus geometric information and diffusion tensor tractography.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: Previously, our workgroup developed a thalamus atlas by fusing anatomic information from 7 histologically processed thalami. Thalamocortical connectivity maps were generated from {DTI} scans of 40 subjects by using a previously described procedure and were mapped to a standard neuroimaging space. These data were merged into a statistical shape model describing the morphologic variability of the thalamic outline, nuclei, and connectivity landmarks. This model was used to deform the atlas to individual images. Postmortem {MR} imaging scans were used to quantify the accuracy of nuclei predictions.
{RESULTS}: Reliable tractography-based markers were located in the ventral lateral thalamus, with the somatosensory connections coinciding with the {VPLa} and {VPLp} nuclei; and motor/premotor connections, with the {VLpv} and {VLa} nuclei. Prediction accuracy of thalamus outlines was higher with the {SSM} approach than the {ACPC} alignment of data (0.56 mm versus 1.24; Dice overlap: 0.87 versus 0.7); for individual nuclei: 0.65 mm, Dice: 0.63 ({SSM}); 1.24 mm, Dice: 0.4 ({ACPC}).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Previous studies have already applied {DTI} to the thalamus. As a further step in this direction, we demonstrate a hybrid approach by using statistical shape models, which have the potential to cope with intersubject variations in individual thalamus geometry.},

	abstract = {Brain imaging studies contribute to the neurobiological understanding of Autism Spectrum Conditions ({ASC}). Herein, we tested the prediction that distributed neurodevelopmental abnormalities in brain development impact on the homogeneity of brain tissue measured using texture analysis ({TA}; a morphological method for surface pattern characterization). {TA} was applied to structural magnetic resonance brain scans of 54 adult participants (24 with Asperger syndrome ({AS}) and 30 controls). Measures of mean gray-level intensity, entropy and uniformity were extracted from gray matter images at fine, medium and coarse textures. Comparisons between {AS} and controls identified higher entropy and lower uniformity across textures in the {AS} group. Data reduction of texture parameters revealed three orthogonal principal components. These were used as regressors-of-interest in a voxel-based morphometry analysis that explored the relationship between surface texture variations and regional gray matter volume. Across the {AS} but not control group, measures of entropy and uniformity were related to the volume of the caudate nuclei, whereas mean gray-level was related to the size of the cerebellar vermis. Similar to neuropathological studies, our study provides evidence for distributed abnormalities in the structural integrity of gray matter in adults with {ASC}, in particular within corticostriatal and corticocerebellar networks. Additionally, this in-vivo technique may be more sensitive to fine microstructural organization than other more traditional magnetic resonance approaches and serves as a future testable biomarker in {AS} and other neurodevelopmental disorders.},

However, immense quantities of data and high complexity of the algorithms often used are computationally demanding. As a result, there now exists a wide range of techniques of medical image processing and analysis that require the application of high-performance computing solutions in order to reduce the required runtime. The main purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive reference source of techniques of medical image processing and analysis that have been accelerated by high-performance computing solutions. With this in mind, the articles available in the Scopus and Web of Science electronic repositories were searched. Subsequently, the most relevant articles found were individually analyzed in order to identify: (a) the metrics used to evaluate computing performance, (b) the high-performance computing solution used, (c) the parallel design adopted, and (d) the task of medical image processing and analysis involved. Hence, the techniques of medical image processing and analysis found were identified, reviewed, and discussed, particularly in terms of computational performance. Consequently, the techniques reviewed herein present the progress made so far in reducing the computational runtime involved, and the difficulties and challenges that remain to be overcome.},

Still, the quality and interpretability of medical images are regularly hindered by various sources of noise. This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of traditional noise reduction techniques in medical imaging, addressing challenges posed by quantum noise, electronic noise, radiation interference, and other factors. The study delves into spatial filtering, frequency domain filtering, statistical methods, probability-based noise reduction, and adaptive filtering techniques. Each method is analyzed for its applicability and effectiveness in mitigating noise while preserving diagnostically relevant information. The comparative analysis provides insights into the strengths and limitations of these techniques, guiding practitioners in selecting appropriate methods based on imaging modalities and noise characteristics.
