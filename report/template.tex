	\begin{abstract}
		\noindent In recent times, there has been a desire to monitor vital signs such as heartrate in a continuous and cost-effective manner through use of wearable devices. Photoplethysmography presents itself as a robust technology to accomplish that goal despite its initial drawback of high signal noise. Such noise can be relatively easily removed by the use of well-known digital filtering. Thereafter, a heartbeat detection algorithm can be applied to the filtered signal. While these operations are at first applied to the offline signal, translating the implementation on a microcontroller allows for real-time signal filtering and hearbeat detection. This study presents digital filters that succesfully remove the unwanted noise and an algorithm that successfully counts the peaks of heartbeats. While the filtering was also successfully perfomed in real-time, the heartbeat detection algorithm failed to produce an output when carried out in real-time. Further research will be required to refine the results from this study.
