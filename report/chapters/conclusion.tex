\section{Conclusion}
In this study, we first identified and applied suitable filters to our signal, evaluating their performance through power spectrum density analysis. We then developed an algorithm designed to detect peaks, which was subsequently implemented on a microcontroller. Despite the algorithm's promising performance in initial evaluations, the final objective of real-time peak detection to compute heart rate was not achieved due to implementation issues on the microcontroller. Further debugging and refinement are required to realize real-time heart rate computation.
