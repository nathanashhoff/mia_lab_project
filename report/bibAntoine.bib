They believe that this mechanism prevents internal sensations from interfering with the brain’s perception of the external world. This mechanism could also have something to do with anxiety disorders.},

	abstract = {The use of wearable devices or “wearables” in the physical activity domain has been increasing in the last years. These devices are used as training tools providing the user with detailed information about individual physiological responses and feedback to the physical training process. Advantages in sensor technology, miniaturization, energy consumption and processing power increased the usability of these wearables. Furthermore, available sensor technologies must be reliable, valid, and usable. Considering the variety of the existing sensors not all of them are suitable to be integrated in wearables. The application and development of wearables has to consider the characteristics of the physical training process to improve the effectiveness and efﬁciency as training tools. During physical training, it is essential to elicit individual optimal strain to evoke the desired adjustments to training. One important goal is to neither overstrain nor under challenge the user. Many wearables use heart rate as indicator for this individual strain. However, due to a variety of internal and external inﬂuencing factors, heart rate kinetics are highly variable making it difﬁcult to control the stress eliciting individually optimal strain. For optimal training control it is essential to model and predict individual responses and adapt the external stress if necessary. Basis for this modeling is the valid and reliable recording of these individual responses. Depending on the heart rate kinetics and the obtained physiological data, different models and techniques are available that can be used for strain or training control. Aim of this review is to give an overview of measurement, prediction, and control of individual heart rate responses. Therefore, available sensor technologies measuring the individual heart rate responses are analyzed and approaches to model and predict these individual responses discussed. Additionally, the feasibility for wearables is analyzed.},

	abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is an affordable and straightforward optical technique used to detect changes in blood volume within tissue microvascular beds. PPG technology has found widespread application in commercial medical devices, enabling measurements of oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and cardiac output; the assessment of autonomic nerve function; and the diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease. Recently, the growing demand for non-invasive, portable, cost-effective technology, along with advancements in small semiconductor components, has led to the integration of PPG into various wrist-worn wearable devices. Multiple sensor structures have been proposed and, through appropriate signal processing and algorithmic application, these wearable devices can measure a range of health indicators during daily life. This paper begins by addressing the market status of wrist-worn wearable devices, followed by an explanation of the fundamental principles underlying light operation and its interaction with living tissue for PPG measurements. Moving on to technological advancements, the paper addresses the analog front end for the measurement of the PPG signal, sensor conﬁgurations with multiple light emitters and receivers, the minimum sampling rate required for low-power systems, and the measurement of stress, sleep, blood pressure, blood glucose, and activity using PPG signals. Several challenges in the ﬁeld are also identiﬁed, including selecting the appropriate wavelength for the PPG sensor’s light source, developing lowpower interpolation methods to extract high-resolution inter-beat intervals at a low sampling rate, and exploring the measurement of physiological phenomena using multi-wavelength PPG signals simultaneously collected at the same location. Lastly, the paper presents future research directions, which encompass the development of new, reliable parameters speciﬁc to wearable PPG devices and conducting studies in real-world scenarios, such as 24-h long-term measurements.},

Researchers from different domains of science have become increasingly interested in PPG because of its advantages as non-invasive, inexpensive, and convenient diagnostic tool. Traditionally, it measures the oxygen saturation, blood pressure, cardiac output, and for assessing autonomic functions. Moreover, PPG is a promising technique for early screening of various atherosclerotic pathologies and could be helpful for regular GP-assessment but a full understanding of the diagnostic value of the different features is still lacking. Recent studies emphasise the potential information embedded in the PPG waveform signal and it deserves further attention for its possible applications beyond pulse oximetry and heart-rate calculation. Therefore, this overview discusses different types of artifact added to PPG signal, characteristic features of PPG waveform, and existing indexes to evaluate for diagnoses.},

	abstract = {Within the context of screening tests, it is important to avoid misconceptions about sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. In this article, therefore, foundations are first established concerning these metrics along with the first of several aspects of pliability that should be recognized in relation to those metrics. Clarification is then provided about the definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values and why researchers and clinicians can misunderstand and misrepresent them. Arguments are made that sensitivity and specificity should usually be applied only in the context of describing a screening test’s attributes relative to a reference standard; that predictive values are more appropriate and informative in actual screening contexts, but that sensitivity and specificity can be used for screening decisions about individual people if they are extremely high; that predictive values need not always be high and might be used to advantage by adjusting the sensitivity and specificity of screening tests; that, in screening contexts, researchers should provide information about all four metrics and how they were derived; and that, where necessary, consumers of health research should have the skills to interpret those metrics effectively for maximum benefit to clients and the healthcare system.},
